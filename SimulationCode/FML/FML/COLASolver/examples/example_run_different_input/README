Example of starting the simulation with different input:
1) CDM+baryon Power-spectrum P(k,z=0)
2) CDM+baryon Transfer funcion T(k,z=0)
3) Transferinfo file (which reads a bunch of T(k,z) files and makes splines - required for doing massive neutrinos)
All of these should give the same result in this case.
